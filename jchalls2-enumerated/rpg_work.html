                Over the course of nearly a decade, I have poured my heart and soul into crafting "The Lost: a Pen and Paper Roleplaying Game". 
            </p>
            <p>
                Each passing year has seen my dedication to this project grow, resulting in a mostly complete Player's Manual that I can now proudly present.

                "The Lost: A Pen and Paper Roleplaying Game" take inspiration from many other character buidling focused games, such as G.U.R.P.S., Mutants and Masterminds, and Open Wolrd RPG in that the game focuses on bredth of creative expresion with custom character abilities as well as tools to create custom heritages and classes. 
            </p>  
            <p>
                You can be anything in The Lost as long as you can convince your GM.
            </p>  
            <p>
                The combat elements are inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, thought they are heavily modified for balance with the Custom ability mechanics.
